# Overview
This document is a part of a making visuals course and in this particlar document we are working with sketches from the repository of Matt DesLauriers [https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). 

## First Steps
To install a library with an npm

``sh
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g
``


Now we can create a new sketch from scratch with the following command

``sh
npx canvas-sketch-cli sketch-01.js --new --open
``
