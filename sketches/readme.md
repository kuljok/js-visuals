# Overview
This document is a part of a making visuals course and in this particlar document we are working with sketches from the repository of Matt DesLauriers [https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). 

## First Steps
To install a library with an npm

```sh
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g
```


Now we can create a new sketch from scratch with the following command

```sh
npx canvas-sketch-cli sketch-01.js --new --open
```


## Canvase Features
We can save anything we draw by pressing `CMD+S`. By default it saves `PNG` files into `Downloads` folder. We can change the output folder: 

```sh
npx canvas-sketch-cli sketch-01.js --output=output/01
```
